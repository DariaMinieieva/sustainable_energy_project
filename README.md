## CURRENT SITUATION
Nowadays, more and more people prefer alternative energy sources to traditional ones because of absence of harmful emissions into the atmosphere, environmental friendliness, inexhaustibility of resources, safety for the environment, economic benefit and long service life. In addition, there is a tendency to abandon traditional energy sources due to their exhaustion. The time when the reserves of fuel and energy resources are depleted is very close - it is commensurate with the change from 2-3 to 5-6 generations.

## THE PROBLEM
That is why, despite the high cost of equipment, people are willing to spend huge sums on renewable energy installations. However, their effectiveness largely depends on the characteristics of the climate, which can complicate the use of solar energy, wind and other natural phenomena. And, unfortunately, due to such ignorance, people very often lose their investments, which is why we want to prevent it.
PROGRAM’S AIM AND CHARACTERISTICS
The problem that our team will study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of installing a variety of alternative energy sources, and to determine the most favorable locations near the user's location. The assessment of the benefits and profitability of the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, in any part of the world, will be based on data on weather conditions and other natural factors that are important for these sources. An interactive map will be developed to present the results of the study.
The purpose of the program is to simplify a search for a place to install an alternative energy source - a solar panel or wind turbine. Program’s main functional is: the user chooses what kind of alternative sources he is interested in, sets the location and radius within which the analysis of the territory will be carried out. After that, the program calculates the efficiency of the selected energy source at the selected location and at points within the radius. The user receives information about the most favorable place to install the energy source, as well as the best direction to install if a wind turbine is selected. The results can be seen on the map and can also be downloaded in .txt format.

## PROGRAM’S STRUCTURE AND SHORT DESCRIPTION OF MODULES, FUNCTIONS, CLASSES AND METHODS


## SHORT INSTRUCTION
1. To use the program, you need to follow the link to the site.
2. Then you need to choose a source of energy - solar panels or wind turbines. Click on the "NEXT" button.
3. On the page dedicated to the selected energy source, enter the latitude, longitude and radius.
4. Click on the “OPEN MAP” button to go to the interactive map or to “DOWNLOAD RESULTS” to get the results in .txt format.

## TESTS’ DESCRIPTION


## INPUT AND OUTPUT DATA
At first, the user chooses the alternative energy source that interests him most. On the page of the selected alternative source, the user is asked to enter data about his or her location: latitude, longitude;  and radius in kilometers for the furthest possible location for the installation of an alternative energy source. As a result, the user gets a map with locations within the maximum specified radius. The map also shows the efficiency of installing an alternative energy source for each point, and shows the location with the highest efficiency. If the user has chosen wind turbines, he also receives information about the best direction for the wind turbine. You can also download the results as a .txt file with the information about the efficiency of the installation in each location; and the most profitable direction of the wind turbine
